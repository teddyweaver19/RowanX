Arduino IDE program that commands a small robotic car that can go backwards, forwards, left, right and the corresponding diagonals. It has a pincher on the front that we used to pick up trash and carry to trash cans.  The car and pincher are controlled by a joystick and if you press the joystick down it closes/opens the pincher.
